Golden Hour Cafe – Capstone Project

Capstone Summary

This Capstone project is a Java console application designed to simulate a real ordering system for a smoothie shop. 
It allows users to choose smoothie bowls, juices, toppings, and sides through a menu-driven interface. 
The program uses object-oriented programming to organize everything into classes, and it saves a receipt for each order as a text file.


Main Steps of the Capstone Project:

This Capstone was larger than the last one, I chose to do a custom theme, which took extra  planning and required extra steps. I had to make sure 
that I met the same requirements as my peers who were using a premade template. The first day consisted of creating my chart that highlighted all of the components 
in my shop application. I decided to do a Smoothie Shop! Although the project did overwhelm me as far as components, I was up for the challenge.

above, I have attached a link to my template that outlines my shop items and prices to mimic the structure of the premade templates.

I used Jira to help guide me with the main components of the project. Important things to note and ask yourself before a project is "WHAT am I trying to achieve? What do I need to learn to achieve that?" What exact resources are needed? Thinking about these steps beforehand, helped me greatly when it came to tackling this Capstone.

Code Organization and Package Structure:

Because this application contains many different classes (such as SmoothieBase, Juice, Side, Order, ReceiptFileManager, and various user interface screens), it was important to organize them into separate packages. Creating packages allowed me to group related classes together, keep the project easier to navigate, and prevent the code from becoming messy or confusing as the application grew. You can see this with the picture above!

Challenges: Receipt File Manager

One of the biggest obstacles in this project was building the ReceiptFileManager. Getting the receipts to print correctly was more difficult than expected. The formatting kept appearing in the wrong places, certain values weren’t showing up correctly, and small issues—like booleans printing as “true” on the receipt—made the output look incorrect.

It took multiple rounds of testing, rewriting methods, and reorganizing how items were added to the receipt before everything formatted the way it was supposed to. This part of the project pushed me to slow down, debug carefully, and understand how Java file writing really works.

I was able to overcome this challenge with the help of my peers.
Thank you to Ignacio, Jaylen, Hunbal, and John for supporting me and helping me work through the tricky parts.

I created a fully interactive menu system so that my presentation would feel engaging and connected to real-world applications. Instead of showing only code or static examples, I wanted users to experience the ordering process the same way a customer would in an actual café.



Resources: I enjoy using our workbooks. Heavily relied on workbook 5a. The workbooks in general re great for getting a refresher on our past lessons and provide many great visual examples. I also used 
W3 schools, Oracle and my classmates for help!! THANK YOU TO EVERYONE! <3
