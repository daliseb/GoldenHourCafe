Golden Hour Cafe – Capstone Project

Capstone Summary

This capstone project is a Java console application designed to simulate a real ordering system for a smoothie shop. 
It allows users to choose smoothie bowls, juices, toppings, and sides through a menu-driven interface. 
The program uses object-oriented programming to organize everything into classes, and it saves a receipt for each order as a text file.


Main Steps of the Capstone Project:

This capstone was larger than the last one, I chose to do a custom theme, which took extra  planning and required extra steps. I had to make sure 
that I met the same requirements as my peers who were using a premade template. The first day consisted of creating my chart that highlighted all of the components 
in my shop application. I decided to do a Smoothie Shop! Although the project did overwhelm me as far as components, I was up for the challenge.

above, I have attached a link to my template that outlines my shop items and prices to mimic the structure of the premade templates.

Resources: I enjoy using our workbooks, they are great for getting a refresher on our past lessons and provide many great visual examples. I also used 
W3 schools, Oracle and my classmates for help!!
